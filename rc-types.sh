    Indicate relative clause subtype. Adds in the MISC column a Cxn (construction) label of the form

        rc-TYPE-DEPRELPATH(-FRONTSTRAND)
    
    TYPE is one of: free, red [reduced], wh, that, cleft.{red,wh,that} (for it-clefts)

    DEPRELPATH is an underscore-separated list of one or more deprels
    indicating the understood role of the relativized element within the relative clause.
    These are derived from the enhanced dependencies graph (but omit lexicalization like ":from").
    The path is bottom-up, ending when the relative clause predicate is reached.
    If the predicate itself is directly relativized, then the path consists of "pred".

    The last part, FRONTSTRAND, is present if:
    - the relative phrase is a fronted PP (-pfront), and/or
    - the relative clause has triggered stranding of a preposition (-pstrand) or
      an auxiliary/copula/infinitive "to" (-auxstrand).
    (-auxstrand is NOT added if the stranded item appears to have been triggered by a comparative
    construction, i.e. it is marked by "as", "like", or "than": e.g. "people who share the same tastes as I do")

    Examples:
        - rc-wh-nsubj for "the boy who lived"
        - rc-red-obj for "all you need (is love)"
        - rc-free-nsubj for "what happens in Vegas (stays in Vegas)"
        - rc-that-obj_xcomp for "somebody that I used to know"
        - rc-cleft.red_obl-pstrand for "who is it he asked for?"
        - rc-free-pred-auxstrand for "(doing) what they can"
        - rc-red-pred-pstrand for "a panel I will be on"
        - rc-wh-nmod_obl-pfront-pstrand for "the cookies (some of which I sat on)"
        - rc-wh-ccomp-auxstrand for "If the baby is feathered yet - which Iâ€™m sure he is mostly"
    
    Many reduced RCs lack an enhanced deprel for the relativized element,
    so "missingedep" serves as a placeholder.

    Note: Some errors arise in cases of nested RCs or multiple RCs sharing the same head.

    TODO: consider refining -auxstrand rules to avoid matching cases like
        obtain the very best possible education they can
        is there someone else that will
    (should ellipsis nodes be added?)

    TODO: "at the exact same positions they were" (missing P?)
